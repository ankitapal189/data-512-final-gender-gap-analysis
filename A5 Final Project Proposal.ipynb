    "# Final Project\n",
    "## Motivation and problem statement: \n",
    "\n",
    "Gender Gap is a topic that has been debated for several years. It is potentially very interesting to study the growth or reduction of gender gap over the years. The best way to quantify this is by exploring various areas like health, education, economy and politics. It would also be interesting to see if the world average of these parameters follows the same trends as that of US. \n",
    "\n",
    "This will be useful from a human-centered perspective because gender bias has been prevalent in our society since ages. This has given males an advantage over females over the years. But, as women are advancing in various fields, we see the gap diminishing. This project quantifies this decrease/increase in gap and the areas we need to concentrate on to remove this gap\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data selected for analysis: \n",
    "\n",
    "I am planning to use the World Development Indicators(WDI) dataset. I am planning to use this because it has a wide variety of indicators that I can compare to access the stage of males vs females. I can easily apply filters and change the country that I am interested in.\n",
    "\n",
    "WDI has various indicators related to health, education, economy and politics for various countries of the world from 1960 onwards.\n",
    "\n",
    "Link [WDI dataset](https://datacatalog.worldbank.org/dataset/world-development-indicators)\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Unknowns and dependencies: \n",
    "\n",
    "The absence of data will impact my ability to complete this project by end of this quarter. I notice that the data is very sparse. If I do not get the data for US and the World for the major parameters like - education, literacy, employement etc. then I may have to change the scope to countries for where data is available. \n",
    "Another scenario would be that there is not defined trend in the parameters that indicate the bias. In that case I would have to conclude that there is not general trend of increase/decrease in bias in that particular area of study."

    "## Research questions and/or hypotheses:\n",
    "\n",
    "I have identified the indicators related to the 4 major areas mentioned in the report.\n",
    " 1. Economic participation and opportunity:\n",
    "     1. Labour force participation\n",
    " 2. Educational attainment\n",
    "     1. Literacy rate\n",
    "     2. Enrolment in primary education\n",
    "     3. Enrolment in secondary education\n",
    "     4. Enrolment in tertiary education\n",
    " 3. Health and survival\n",
    "     1. Sex ratio at birth\n",
    "     2. Life expectancy\n",
    " 4. Political empowerment\n",
    "     1. Proportion of seats held by women in national parliaments (%)\n",
    "     \n",
    "The 2 analysis questions I will be looking into are:\n",
    "1. How has the gender gap increased/decreased in these 4 areas?\n",
    "2. Is the change in these areas same at global level as well as US level?\n",
    "\n",
    "## Background/Related Work:\n",
    "\n",
    "My area of research is inspired by the [Global Gender Gap Report](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Gender_Gap_Report#:~:text=The%20report's%20Gender%20Gap%20Index,gender%20equality%20in%20a%20country.&text=Gender%20imbalances%20to%20the%20advantage%20of%20women%20do%20not%20affect%20the%20score.)\n",
    "This report measures \"gender-based gaps in access to resources and opportunities in countries\"\n",
    "\n",
    "The 4 areas mentioned are:\n",
    "\n",
    " 1. **Economic participation and opportunity:**\n",

    "  The three concepts taken into consideration: \n",
    "  1. Participation gap: Captures difference between women and men in labour force participation rates.\n",
    "  2. Remuneration gap : Captures difference between women and men in terms of renumeration for same work.\n",
    "  3. Advancement gap : Captures ratio of women to men among legislators, senior officials and managers, and the ratio of women to men among technical and professional workers.\n",
    " 2. **Educational attainment:** \n",
    " \n",
    " The indicators taken into consideration can be found [here](https://tcdata360.worldbank.org/indicators/82bb9059?country=BRA&indicator=28160&viz=line_chart&years=2006,2018) It captures the gap between women 's and men 's current access to education through ratios of women to men in primary-, secondary- and tertiary-level education.\n",
    " 3. **Health and survival**\n",
    " \n",
    "     The indicators taken into consideration can be found [here](https://tcdata360.worldbank.org/indicators/e06df634?country=BRA&indicator=28163&viz=line_chart&years=2006,2018)\n",
    "     Captures life expectancy and sex ratio\n",
    " 4. **Political empowerment**\n",
    " \n",

Caputres gap between men and women at the highest level of political decision-making through the ratio of women to men in minister-level positions and the ratio of women to men in parliamentary positions.\n",

    "I will use graphs to study the trend if gender graphs in the 4 areas. Graphs would be the best place to start our analysis. We could dive into the quantitive calculations if we find significant patterns. The indicators where data is present for male as well as female, we could create new indicator which would be a ratio of female to male. Analysing the trends of these ratios will also be useful. I will perform a correlation analysis of all vs all indicatiors. This will help us unearth any inter-dependencies.\n",
